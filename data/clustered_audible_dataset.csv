"Altered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body",Daniel Goleman,4.3,270,668.0,"Two New York Times best-selling authors unveil new research showing what meditation can really do for the brain. In the last 20 years, meditation and mindfulness have gone from being kind of cool to becoming an omnipresent Band-Aid for fixing everything from your weight to your relationship to your achievement level. Unveiling here the kind of cutting-edge research that has made them giants in their fields, Daniel Goleman and Richard J Davidson show us the truth about what meditation can really do for us, as well as exactly how to get the most out of it. Sweeping away common misconceptions and neuromythology to open listeners' eyes to the ways data has been distorted to sell mind-training methods, the authors demonstrate that beyond the pleasant states mental exercises can produce, the real payoffs are the lasting personality traits that can result. But short daily doses will not get us to the highest level of lasting positive change - even if we continue for years - without specific additions. More than sheer hours, we need smart practice, including crucial ingredients such as targeted feedback from a master teacher and a more spacious, less attached view of the self, all of which are missing in widespread versions of mind training. The authors also reveal the latest data from Davidson's own lab that point to a new methodology for developing a broader array of mind-training methods with larger implications for how we can derive the greatest benefits from the practice. Exciting, compelling, and grounded in new research, this is one of those rare books that has the power to change us at the deepest level.",548.0,"['043 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals', 'Neuroscience & Neuropsychology', 'Biological Sciences', 'Meditation']",Very Good,Medium-Low,Long,5.602119,1631,advanced_only,two new york time best selling author unveil new research showing meditation really brain last year meditation mindfulness gone kind cool becoming omnipresent band aid fixing everything weight relationship achievement level unveiling kind cutting edge research made giant field daniel goleman richard davidson show truth meditation really well exactly get sweeping away common misconception neuromythology open listener eye way data distorted sell mind training method author demonstrate beyond pleasant state mental exercise produce real payoff lasting personality trait result short daily dos get highest level lasting positive change even continue year without specific addition sheer hour need smart practice including crucial ingredient targeted feedback master teacher spacious less attached view self missing widespread version mind training author also reveal latest data davidson lab point new methodology developing broader array mind training method larger implication derive greatest benefit practice exciting compelling grounded new research one rare book power change deepest level,altered trait science reveals meditation change mind brain body,audible audiobooks original neuroscience neuropsychology biological science meditation,altered trait science reveals meditation change mind brain body two new york time best selling author unveil new research showing meditation really brain last year meditation mindfulness gone kind cool becoming omnipresent band aid fixing everything weight relationship achievement level unveiling kind cutting edge research made giant field daniel goleman richard davidson show truth meditation really well exactly get sweeping away common misconception neuromythology open listener eye way data distorted sell mind training method author demonstrate beyond pleasant state mental exercise produce real payoff lasting personality trait result short daily dos get highest level lasting positive change even continue year without specific addition sheer hour need smart practice including crucial ingredient targeted feedback master teacher spacious less attached view self missing widespread version mind training author also reveal latest data davidson lab point new methodology developing broader array mind training method larger implication derive greatest benefit practice exciting compelling grounded new research one rare book power change deepest level audible audiobooks original neuroscience neuropsychology biological science meditation,2,0,0.6588252825977234,-2.1231372937085244,15.222697,-13.887242

The interrogation, which was done by the army and police, included torture of the worst kind imaginable. Many of his comrades went insane or ended their own lives.

His book begins with the story of a salesman who is able to sell more, and make more money than his co-salesmen. He is not highly qualified, influential, or smarter than his friends.

What does watching TV do to a child’s brain? What’s the best way to handle temper tantrums? Scientists know. In his New York Times best seller Brain Rules, Dr. John Medina showed us how our brains really work - and why we ought to redesign our workplaces and schools. Now, in Brain Rules for Baby, he shares what the latest science says about how to raise smart and happy children from zero to five. This book is destined to revolutionize parenting. Just one of the surprises: The best way to get your children into the college of their choice? Teach them impulse control. Brain Rules for Baby bridges the gap between what scientists know and what parents practice. Through fascinating and funny stories, Medina, a developmental molecular biologist and dad, unravels how a child’s brain develops - and what you can do to optimize it. You will view your children - and how to raise them - in a whole new light. You’ll learn: Where nature ends and nurture begins. Why men should do more household chores. What you do when emotions run hot affects how your baby turns out, because babies need to feel safe above all. TV is harmful for children under two. Your child’s ability to relate to others predicts her future math performance. Smart and happy are inseparable. Pursuing your child’s intellectual success at the expense of his happiness achieves neither. Praising effort is better than praising intelligence. The best predictor of academic performance is not IQ. It’s self-control.

Creating Great Choices: A Leader's Guide to Integrative Thinking,Jennifer Riel,4.7,35,703.0,"A practical four-step methodology for any leader or manager facing a tough choice, and for creating integrative solutions to big, complex, and pressing problems. Conventional wisdom - and business school curricula - teaches us that making trade-offs is inevitable when it comes to hard choices. But sometimes, accepting the obvious trade-off just isn't good enough: the choices in front of us don't get us what we need. In those cases, rather than choosing the least worst option, we can use the models in front of us to create a new and better answer. This is integrative thinking. First introduced by Roger Martin in The Opposable Mind, integrative thinking is an approach to problem solving that uses opposing ideas as the basis for innovation. Now, in Creating Great Choices, Martin and fellow Rotman expert Jennifer Riel vividly show how they have refined and enhanced the understanding and practice of integrative thinking through their work teaching the concept and its principles to business and nonprofit executives, MBA students, even kids. Integrative thinking has been embraced by organizations such as Procter & Gamble, Deloitte, Verizon, and the Toronto District School Board - all seeking a replicable, thoughtful approach to creating a ""third and better way"" to make important choices in the face of unacceptable trade-offs. The book includes new stories of successful integrative thinkers that will demystify the process of creative problem solving.

Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crises,James Rickards,4.5,773,738.0,"In 1971, President Nixon imposed national price controls and took the United States off the gold standard, an extreme measure intended to end an ongoing currency war that had destroyed faith in the U.S. dollar. Today we are engaged in a new currency war, and this time the consequences will be far worse than those that confronted Nixon. Currency wars are one of the most destructive and feared outcomes in international economics. At best, they offer the sorry spectacle of countries' stealing growth from their trading partners. At worst, they degenerate into sequential bouts of inflation, recession, retaliation, and sometimes actual violence. Left unchecked, the next currency war could lead to a crisis worse than the panic of 2008.Currency wars have happened before-twice in the last century alone-and they always end badly. Time and again, paper currencies have collapsed, assets have been frozen, gold has been confiscated, and capital controls have been imposed. And the next crash is overdue. Recent headlines about the debasement of the dollar, bailouts in Greece and Ireland, and Chinese currency manipulation are all indicators of the growing conflict.As James Rickards argues in Currency Wars, this is more than just a concern for economists and investors. The United States is facing serious threats to its national security, from clandestine gold purchases by China to the hidden agendas of sovereign wealth funds. Greater than any single threat is the very real danger of the collapse of the dollar itself.Baffling to many observers is the rank failure of economists to foresee or prevent the economic catastrophes of recent years. Not only have their theories failed to prevent calamity, they are making the currency wars worse. The U. S. Federal Reserve has engaged in the greatest gamble in the history of finance, a sustained effort to stimulate the economy by printing money on a trillion-dollar scale. Its solutions present hidden new dangers while resolving none of the current dilemmas. While the outcome of the new currency war is not yet certain, some version of the worst-case scenario is almost inevitable if U.S. and world economic leaders fail to learn from the mistakes of their predecessors.",592.0,"['561 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals', 'Economics', '067 in Economics Books', '#52', '973 in Textbooks & Study Guides']",Excellent,Medium-High,Long,6.6515718,2225,both,president nixon imposed national price control took united state gold standard extreme measure intended end ongoing currency war destroyed faith dollar today engaged new currency war time consequence far worse confronted nixon currency war one destructive feared outcome international economics best offer sorry spectacle country stealing growth trading partner worst degenerate sequential bout inflation recession retaliation sometimes actual violence left unchecked next currency war could lead crisis worse panic currency war happened twice last century alone always end badly time paper currency collapsed asset frozen gold confiscated capital control imposed next crash overdue recent headline debasement dollar bailouts greece ireland chinese currency manipulation indicator growing conflict james rickards argues currency war concern economist investor united state facing serious threat national security clandestine gold purchase china hidden agenda sovereign wealth fund greater single threat real danger collapse dollar baffling many observer rank failure economist foresee prevent economic catastrophe recent year theory failed prevent calamity making currency war worse federal reserve engaged greatest gamble history finance sustained effort stimulate economy printing money trillion dollar scale solution present hidden new danger resolving none current dilemma outcome new currency war yet certain version worst case scenario almost inevitable world economic leader fail learn mistake predecessor,currency war making next global crisis,audible audiobooks original economics economics book  textbook study guide,currency war making next global crisis president nixon imposed national price control took united state gold standard extreme measure intended end ongoing currency war destroyed faith dollar today engaged new currency war time consequence far worse confronted nixon currency war one destructive feared outcome international economics best offer sorry spectacle country stealing growth trading partner worst degenerate sequential bout inflation recession retaliation sometimes actual violence left unchecked next currency war could lead crisis worse panic currency war happened twice last century alone always end badly time paper currency collapsed asset frozen gold confiscated capital control imposed next crash overdue recent headline debasement dollar bailouts greece ireland chinese currency manipulation indicator growing conflict james rickards argues currency war concern economist investor united state facing serious threat national security clandestine gold purchase china hidden agenda sovereign wealth fund greater single threat real danger collapse dollar baffling many observer rank failure economist foresee prevent economic catastrophe recent year theory failed prevent calamity making currency war worse federal reserve engaged greatest gamble history finance sustained effort stimulate economy printing money trillion dollar scale solution present hidden new danger resolving none current dilemma outcome new currency war yet certain version worst case scenario almost inevitable world economic leader fail learn mistake predecessor audible audiobooks original economics economics book  textbook study guide,2,0,0.11311695552077074,-1.798157856568706,13.066559,26.222534

"Eastern Body, Western Mind: Psychology and the Chakra System as a Path to the Self",Anodea Judith,4.7,752,1172.0,"In Eastern Body, Western Mind, chakra authority Anodea Judith has brought a fresh approach to the yoga-based Eastern chakra system, adapting it to the Western framework of Jungian psychology, somatic therapy, childhood developmental theory, and metaphysics.

Yeah, but who cares about writing anymore? In a time-challenged world dominated by short and snappy, by click-bait headlines and Twitter streams and Instagram feeds and gifs and video and Snapchat and YOLO and LOL and #tbt... does the idea of focusing on writing seem pedantic and ordinary? Actually, writing matters more now, not less. Our online words are our currency; they tell our customers who we are. Our writing can make us look smart or it can make us look stupid. It can make us seem fun, or warm, or competent, or trustworthy. But it can also make us seem humdrum or discombobulated or flat-out boring. That means you've got to choose words well, and write with economy and the style and honest empathy for your customers. And it means you put a new value on an often-overlooked skill in content marketing: How to write, and how to tell a true story really, really well.

Judgement Detox: Release the Beliefs That Hold You Back from Living a Better Life,Gabrielle Bernstein,4.5,564,469.0,"Judgement - both being judged and judging others - is at the core of our discomfort and the root of many of our life blocks. When we judge others, we get a quick hit of self-righteousness. Judgement can get us through when we feel hurt, insecure, or vulnerable. But inevitably this feeling of righteousness fades and judgement causes our energy to weaken and our thoughts to darken. Spiritual thought leader Gabrielle Bernstein made the commitment to heal her own relationship to judgement and changed her life in profound ways. She found that becoming more aware of her judgements made her a more mindful and conscious person. Her willingness to revise these perceptions has set her free. Here Gabrielle shares the process she used to liberate herself - a six-step interactive programme that calls on spiritual principles from A Course in Miracles, Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and other metaphysical and healing teachings. When you follow the process and become willing to let go, judgement, pain and suffering will begin to dissolve.",310.0,"['024 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals', 'Personal Success', '440 in Mind', 'Body & Spirit', '460 in Personal Development & Self-Help']",Excellent,Low,Medium,6.336826,1035,both,judgement judged judging others core discomfort root many life block judge others get quick hit self righteousness judgement get feel hurt insecure vulnerable inevitably feeling righteousness fade judgement cause energy weaken thought darken spiritual thought leader gabrielle bernstein made commitment heal relationship judgement changed life profound way found becoming aware judgement made mindful conscious person willingness revise perception set free gabrielle share process used liberate six step interactive programme call spiritual principle course miracle kundalini yoga meditation metaphysical healing teaching follow process become willing let judgement pain suffering begin dissolve,judgement detox release belief hold back living better life,audible audiobooks original personal success mind body spirit personal development self help,judgement detox release belief hold back living better life judgement judged judging others core discomfort root many life block judge others get quick hit self righteousness judgement get feel hurt insecure vulnerable inevitably feeling righteousness fade judgement cause energy weaken thought darken spiritual thought leader gabrielle bernstein made commitment heal relationship judgement changed life profound way found becoming aware judgement made mindful conscious person willingness revise perception set free gabrielle share process used liberate six step interactive programme call spiritual principle course miracle kundalini yoga meditation metaphysical healing teaching follow process become willing let judgement pain suffering begin dissolve audible audiobooks original personal success mind body spirit personal development self help,2,0,0.22363035940876105,-2.4822911008778235,41.73229,16.781023

We wait for a spouse, wait for a baby, wait on our children, wait for our parents. We wait for clarity and direction. We wait on a job, a promotion, a new direction. We wait for hope, for healing, and for miracles. We wait on God. And when we misunderstand what waiting is about, we can get confused about what God is up to. Waiting is one of God’s favorite tools. He can do certain things in our hearts, our lives, and our relationships while we wait - things we cannot experience once we’ve opened the gift we have been waiting for. So just you wait, because everyone takes their turn in the waiting room. It’s a long and painful fact of life, but shortcuts and microwaves aren’t the answer. God is at work behind the scenes in invisible ways you can’t see...yet. Just you wait and see how ready you’ll be if you spend your waiting well. Because when your opportunity comes, you don’t want to spend more time on the bench. When you wait well, you can say, “Look out, world: I am getting ready to shine.

In his previous book, The Fabric of Reality, Deutsch describe the four deepest strands of existing knowledge-the theories of evolution, quantum physics, knowledge, and computation-arguing jointly they reveal a unified fabric of reality.

The Complete TurtleTrader: How 23 Novice Investors Became Overnight Millionaires,Michael W. Covel,4.4,415,836.0,"This is the true story behind Wall Street legend Richard Dennis, his disciples, the Turtles, and the trading techniques that made them millionaires. What happens when ordinary people are taught a system to make extraordinary money? Richard Dennis made a fortune on Wall Street by investing according to a few simple rules. Convinced that great trading was a skill that could be taught to anyone, he made a bet with his partner and ran a classified ad in the Wall Street Journal looking for novices to train. His recruits, later known as the Turtles, had anything but traditional Wall Street backgrounds; they included a professional blackjack player, a pianist, and a fantasy game designer. For two weeks, Dennis taught them his investment rules and philosophy, and set them loose to start trading, each with a million dollars of his money. By the time the experiment ended, Dennis had made $100,000,000 from his Turtles and created one killer Wall Street legend. In The Complete Turtle Trader, Michael W. Covel, best-selling author of Trend Following and managing editor of TurtleTrader.com, the leading website on the Turtles, tells their riveting story with the first ever on-the-record interviews with individual Turtles. He describes how Dennis interviewed and selected his students, details their education and experiences while working for him, and breaks down the Turtle system and rules in full. He reveals how they made astounding fortunes, and follows their lives from the original experiment to the present day. Some have grown even wealthier than ever, and include some of today's top hedge fund managers. Equally important are those who passed along their approach to a second generation of Turtles, proving that the Turtles' system truly is reproducible, and that anyone with the discipline and the desire to succeed can do as well as - or even better than - Wall Street's top hedge fund wizards. These rules worked - and still work today - for everyone.",608.0,"['024 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals', 'Investing & Trading Commodities', 'Biographies of Business Leaders', 'Personal Finance']",Very Good,Medium-High,Long,6.0306854,1969,both,true behind wall street legend richard dennis disciple turtle trading technique made millionaire happens ordinary people taught system make extraordinary money richard dennis made fortune wall street investing according simple rule convinced great trading skill could taught anyone made bet partner ran classified wall street journal looking novice train recruit later known turtle anything traditional wall street background included professional blackjack player pianist fantasy game designer two week dennis taught investment rule philosophy set loose start trading million dollar money time experiment ended dennis made turtle created one killer wall street legend complete turtle trader michael covel best selling trend following managing editor turtletrader com leading website turtle tell riveting first ever record interview individual turtle describes dennis interviewed selected student detail education experience working break turtle system rule full reveals made astounding fortune follows life original experiment present day grown even wealthier ever include today top hedge fund manager equally important passed along approach second generation turtle proving turtle system truly reproducible anyone discipline desire succeed well even better wall street top hedge fund wizard rule worked still work today everyone,complete turtletrader novice investor became overnight millionaire,audible audiobooks original investing trading commodity biography business leader personal finance,complete turtletrader novice investor became overnight millionaire true behind wall street legend richard dennis disciple turtle trading technique made millionaire happens ordinary people taught system make extraordinary money richard dennis made fortune wall street investing according simple rule convinced great trading skill could taught anyone made bet partner ran classified wall street journal looking novice train recruit later known turtle anything traditional wall street background included professional blackjack player pianist fantasy game designer two week dennis taught investment rule philosophy set loose start trading million dollar money time experiment ended dennis made turtle created one killer wall street legend complete turtle trader michael covel best selling trend following managing editor turtletrader com leading website turtle tell riveting first ever record interview individual turtle describes dennis interviewed selected student detail education experience working break turtle system rule full reveals made astounding fortune follows life original experiment present day grown even wealthier ever include today top hedge fund manager equally important passed along approach second generation turtle proving turtle system truly reproducible anyone discipline desire succeed well even better wall street top hedge fund wizard rule worked still work today everyone audible audiobooks original investing trading commodity biography business leader personal finance,2,-1,-0.022770387988986517,-1.8648224212340239,51.477642,-3.692657

The Human Magnet Syndrome: Why We Love People Who Hurt Us,Ross Rosenberg M.Ed. LCPC CADC,4.5,526,668.0,"Since the dawn of civilization, men and women have been magnetically and irresistibly drawn together into romantic relationships, not so much by what they see, feel and think, but more by invisible forces. When individuals with healthy emotional backgrounds meet, the irresistible love force creates a sustainable, reciprocal and stable relationship. Codependents and emotional manipulators are similarly enveloped in a seductive dreamlike state; however, it will later unfold into a painful seesaw of love, pain, hope and disappointment.

"The Laws of Simplicity: Design, Technology, Business, LifeDesign, Technology, Business, Life",John Maeda,4.1,110,469.0,"Finally, we are learning that simplicity equals sanity. We’re rebelling against technology that’s too complicated, DVD players with too many menus, and software accompanied by 75-megabyte “read me” manuals. The iPod’s clean gadgetry has made simplicity hip. But sometimes we ﬁnd ourselves caught up in the simplicity paradox: we want something that’s simple and easy to use, but also does all the complex things we might ever want it to do. In The Laws of Simplicity, John Maeda offers ten laws for balancing simplicity and complexity in business, technology, and design - guidelines for needing less and actually getting more. Maeda - a professor in MIT’s Media Lab and a world-renowned graphic designer - explores the question of how we can redeﬁne the notion of “improved” so that it doesn’t always mean something more, something added on. Maeda’s ﬁrst law of simplicity is reduce. It’s not necessarily beneﬁcial to add technology features just because we can. And the features that we do have must be organized (Law 2) in a sensible hierarchy so users aren’t distracted by features and functions they don’t need. But simplicity is not less just for the sake of less. Skip ahead to Law 9: “failure: Some things can never be made simple.” Maeda’s concise guide to simplicity in the digital age shows us how this idea can be a cornerstone of organizations and their products - how it can drive both business and technology. We can learn to simplify without sacriﬁcing comfort and meaning, and we can achieve the balance described in Law 10. This law, which Maeda calls “the one,” tells us: “Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious, and adding the meaningful.”",164.0,"['444 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals', 'Graphic Design', 'Industrial Engineering', 'Business Careers']",Very Good,Low,Short,4.7095304,1664,both,finally learning simplicity equal sanity rebelling technology complicated dvd player many menu software accompanied megabyte manual ipod clean gadgetry made simplicity hip sometimes caught simplicity paradox want something simple easy use also complex thing might ever want law simplicity john maeda offer ten law balancing simplicity complexity business technology design guideline needing less actually getting maeda professor mit medium lab world renowned graphic designer explores question rede notion improved always mean something something added maeda rst law simplicity reduce necessarily bene cial add technology feature feature must organized law sensible hierarchy user distracted feature function need simplicity less sake less skip ahead law failure thing never made simple maeda concise guide simplicity digital age show idea cornerstone organization product drive business technology learn simplify without sacri cing comfort meaning achieve balance described law law maeda call one tell simplicity subtracting obvious adding meaningful,law simplicity design technology business lifedesign technology business life,audible audiobooks original graphic design industrial engineering business career,law simplicity design technology business lifedesign technology business life finally learning simplicity equal sanity rebelling technology complicated dvd player many menu software accompanied megabyte manual ipod clean gadgetry made simplicity hip sometimes caught simplicity paradox want something simple easy use also complex thing might ever want law simplicity john maeda offer ten law balancing simplicity complexity business technology design guideline needing less actually getting maeda professor mit medium lab world renowned graphic designer explores question rede notion improved always mean something something added maeda rst law simplicity reduce necessarily bene cial add technology feature feature must organized law sensible hierarchy user distracted feature function need simplicity less sake less skip ahead law failure thing never made simple maeda concise guide simplicity digital age show idea cornerstone organization product drive business technology learn simplify without sacri cing comfort meaning achieve balance described law law maeda call one tell simplicity subtracting obvious adding meaningful audible audiobooks original graphic design industrial engineering business career,2,0,3.8023872802020517,-1.379256719071702,27.257097,-8.035286

The Silk Roads: A New History of the World,Peter Frankopan,4.6,1793,1338.0,"The sun is setting on the Western world. Slowly but surely, the direction in which the world spins has reversed: where for the last five centuries the globe turned westward on its axis, it now turns to the east.... For centuries fame and fortune were to be found in the West - in the New World of the Americas. Today it is the East that calls out to those in search of adventure and riches. The region stretching from Eastern Europe and sweeping right across Central Asia, deep into China and India, is taking center stage in international politics, commerce, and culture - and is shaping the modern world. This region, the true center of the Earth, is obscure to many in the English-speaking world. Yet this is where civilization itself began, where the world's great religions were born and took root. The Silk Roads were no exotic series of connections but networks that linked continents and oceans together. Along them flowed ideas, goods, disease, and death.

The Viking Spirit: An Introduction to Norse Mythology and Religion,Daniel McCoy,4.7,540,836.0,"The Viking Spirit is an introduction to Norse mythology like no other. As you’d expect from Daniel McCoy, the creator of the endearingly popular website ""Norse Mythology for Smart People"", it’s written to scholarly standards, but in a simple, clear, and entertaining style that’s easy to understand and a pleasure to listen to.

By de-biasing organizations instead of individuals, we can make smart changes that have big impacts. Presenting research-based solutions, Iris Bohnet hands us the tools we need to move the needle in classrooms and boardrooms, in hiring and promotion, benefiting businesses, governments, and the lives of millions. What Works is built on new insights into the human mind. It draws on data collected by companies, universities, and governments in Australia, India, Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States, Zambia, and other countries, often in randomized controlled trials. It points out dozens of evidence-based interventions that could be adopted right now and demonstrates how research is addressing gender bias, improving lives and performance.
